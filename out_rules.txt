       glue sticks, etc.).
            o Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: cardboard, plastic, metal, wood,
                foam, or any pre-fabricated components.
    • Dimensions:
            o Maximum Length: 30 cm.
            o Maximum Diameter: 5 cm.
    • Weight:

5. Scoring
The final score will be a combination of flight duration and horizontal distance.
    • Duration: Measured in seconds, from the moment the rocket leaves the launcher until it
       makes its first contact with the ground.
    • Distance: Measured in meters, horizontally from the launch point to the point of first
       contact with the ground.
6. Safety Regulations
    • Safety is the highest priority. All participants, judges, and spectators must be at a safe
       distance from the launch pad as designated by event staff.

        Event 2: Water Rocket Flight Competition: Rules & Regulations
   1. Competition Overview

This competition challenges engineering students to design, build, and launch a rocket made from
a plastic bottle. The primary goal is to achieve the maximum possible flight time and horizontal
distance. This contest promotes creative problem-solving, teamwork, and the application of
fundamental aerodynamic and physics principles. All teams must adhere strictly to the rules
outlined below.

2. Eligibility
        ➢ The competition is open to all enrolled engineering students.
        ➢ Teams must consist of a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of four (4) members.
        ➢ Each team may only submit one (1) rocket for the competition.

3. Rocket Specifications
.
    • Materials: Rockets must be constructed from one or more standard plastic soda bottles
       (PET bottles).
          o Additional materials such as paper, cardboard, tape, and adhesive (glue, glue sticks,
             etc.) are permitted for fins, nose cones, and other external components.
          o Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: metal, wood, glass, or any pre-
             fabricated components designed for model rocketry.
    • Dimensions:
          o The rocket must be built around a main body tube of standard 2 L or smaller plastic
             soda bottles.
          o Maximum Length: 75 cm.
          o The maximum diameter is determined by the bottle used.
    • Fuel:
          o The only propellant is water and compressed air. No other liquids, gases, or solid
             propellants are permitted.
          o Water Volume: A maximum of 1/3 of the bottle's total volume. This will be
             measured by judges prior to launch.
    • Structure:
          o The rocket must be a single, self-contained unit.
          o Fins and nose cones must be securely attached and may not detach during flight.
          o No external devices or components for active guidance, deployment, or
             stabilization are permitted.

4. Launch & Flight
    • Launch System: All rockets will be launched using a standardized water rocket launcher
       provided by the competition organizers. Teams are not permitted to use their own launch
       systems.
    • Air Pressure: The launch system will be pressurized to a standard pressure of 80 psi for
       all rockets.
    • Launch Attempts: Each team will be given two (2) official launch attempts. The best
       score from these two attempts will be used for final ranking.
    • Pre-Flight Inspection: All rockets must pass a pre-flight inspection by the judges to verify
       adherence to all material and specification rules before being cleared for launch.
5. Scoring
The final score will be a combination of flight duration and horizontal distance.
    • Duration: Measured in seconds, from the moment the rocket leaves the launcher until it
       makes its first contact with the ground.
    • Distance: Measured in meters, horizontally from the launch point to the point of first
       contact with the ground.
6. Safety Regulations
    • Safety is the highest priority. All participants, judges, and spectators must be at a safe
       distance from the launch pad as designated by event staff.
    • All team members within the designated launch area must wear safety goggles, which will
       be provided.
    • Do not attempt to modify the launch system. Any tampering will result in immediate
       disqualification.
    • Any team or individual found to be engaging in unsafe behavior will be immediately
       disqualified.
7. Disqualification
A team will be disqualified for any of the following reasons:
    • Failure to meet the rocket specifications.
    • Use of unapproved materials or propellants.
    • Tampering with the official launch system.
    • Unsportsmanlike conduct or unsafe behavior.

         Event 2: SETU – Bridge Making Competition: Rules and Regulations

SETU is an engaging bridge-making competition that challenges participants to design and
construct model bridges using limited resources. The event aims to test creativity, structural
efficiency, and engineering skills by applying fundamental concepts of civil engineering.
Participants will build bridges with popsicle sticks and adhesive, which will then be tested for
load-bearing capacity and strength-to-weight performance.

Bridge Construction Guidelines

    1.    Span (clear distance between supports): 60 cm (±1 cm).
    2.    Maximum height: 20 cm.
    3.    Maximum width: 8 cm.
    4.    The bridge must be a free-standing structure without external support.
    5.    Bridges must be constructed solely with Popsicle sticks and white adhesive glue (e.g.,
          Fevicol type).
    6.    The use of any other adhesives, fasteners, pins, clips, wires, or tapes is strictly prohibited.
    7.    Popsicle sticks may be cut or trimmed but must not be split into multiple thin pieces.
    8.    Bridges must be completed prior to the event day and brought to the venue for testing.
    9.    Each team is responsible for transporting their bridge safely; any damage during transit is
          the team’s responsibility.

Rules and Regulations:

1. Each team must consist of maximum two members. All participants must be registered
students of their respective institutions.

2. Testing Procedure

    •     Load will be applied at the center of the span.

   •   Additional loading will be done using sandbags or small weights.
   •   Participants themselves will apply the load under supervision.
   •   The bridge must sustain the applied load for at least 20 seconds.
   •   Teams will be given four attempts to increase the load incrementally.
   •   The load carried just before failure will be recorded for calculation.
   •   The Strength-to-Weight Ratio will be calculated as:

                                                 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐤𝐠 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐞

3. Disqualification
   ➢   Use of unauthorized materials.
   ➢   Non-compliance with the given specifications.
   ➢   Misconduct or unfair practices during the event.

4. General Instructions

   ➢   Teams must submit their bridge at the registration desk before testing begins.
   ➢   Once submitted, bridges cannot be altered or repaired.
   ➢   The organizers reserve the right to modify rules if necessary, and any such changes will
       be announced before evaluation.
